# Bug Bounty Agent Toolkit — Plugin Guide

This repo is an agent-portable bug bounty plugin for professional hunting across HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and Immunefi. It supports Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi Agent, Codex-style Agent Skills, and shared `.agents/skills` harnesses.

## What's Here

### Skills (19 domains — load with `/bug-bounty`, `/web2-recon`, `/token-scan`, etc.)

| Skill | Domain |
|---|---|
| `skills/bug-bounty/` | Master workflow — recon to report, all vuln classes, LLM testing, chains |
| `skills/bb-methodology/` | **Hunting mindset + 5-phase non-linear workflow + tool routing + session discipline** |
| `skills/web2-recon/` | Subdomain enum, live host discovery, URL crawling, nuclei |
| `skills/web2-vuln-classes/` | 32 bug classes with bypass tables (SSRF, open redirect, file upload, Agentic AI, BFLA, NoSQLi, semantic confusion, header injection, XXE, WebSocket security, dependency confusion, padding oracle/crypto misuse) |
| `skills/security-arsenal/` | Payloads, bypass tables, gf patterns, always-rejected list |
| `skills/web3-audit/` | 10 smart contract bug classes, closure discipline for ruling candidates in/out, Foundry PoC template, pre-dive kill signals |
| `skills/meme-coin-audit/` | Meme coin rug pull detection, token authority checks, bonding curve exploits, LP attacks |
| `skills/report-writing/` | H1/Bugcrowd/Intigriti/Immunefi report templates, CVSS 3.1, human tone |
| `skills/triage-validation/` | Closure discipline (confirmed/ruled_out/open_proof_gap), 7-Question Gate, 4 gates, never-submit list, conditionally valid table, severity calibration |
| `skills/credential-attack/` | Password spray methodology — when/why, 4-stage pipeline, mode selection, lockout tactics, legal guardrails, pitfalls learned from live tests |
| `skills/mobile-pentest/` | Android/iOS app pentest — runtime-first proxy workflow, APK/IPA decompile for hidden endpoints + secrets, deeplink/exported-activity injection, WebView bridge, SSL pinning bypass |
| `skills/cicd-security/` | CI/CD pipeline hunting — GitHub Actions injection, secret exfil, self-hosted runner poisoning, OIDC abuse, supply chain attacks |
| `skills/graphql-audit/` | GraphQL hunting — introspection, field suggestions (clairvoyance), batching DoS, IDOR via aliasing, injection, auth bypass, depth bombs |
| `skills/diff-review/` | Diff-scoped PR/commit review — in-scope vs out-of-scope rules, how far to follow a change, validation without a live target |
| `skills/whitebox-code-recon/` | Source-first recon for engagements with code access — architecture/entry-point/schema mapping, then backward taint-hunts per vuln class before live testing |
| `skills/capability-chaining/` | Derive novel exploit chains when no known pattern fits — capability primitives (read/write/exec/ssrf/cred/idor), RCE-as-equation table, forward/backward state-space search |
| `skills/opt-in-advanced-techniques/` | ⚠️ **Opt-in only, not default** — broad-scope engagement framing, red-team anti-forensics (requires specific written authorization), narrow product-specific exploit patterns. Use only when explicitly invoked or an engagement's SOW/ROE explicitly authorizes it |
| `skills/argus/` | Six automated scanners for high-value web + LLM bug classes — CORS, CRLF/host-header, NoSQLi, JWT attacks, OOB confirmation (blind SSRF/XXE/SQLi/RCE/Log4Shell), LLM red-team corpus |
| `skills/client-reverse/` | Client-side request-signing / anti-bot token reversal — recover a sign/hmac/nonce field just enough to replay a request outside the client, packet-first staging, JS deobfuscation basics |

## Start Here

```bash
Codex
# /recon target.com
# /hunt target.com
# /validate   (after finding something)
# /report     (after validation passes)
```

## Install Skills

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Install for another harness:

```bash
./install.sh --agent opencode          # ~/.config/opencode/skills + commands + agents
./install.sh --agent pi                # ~/.pi/agent/skills + prompt templates
./install.sh --agent codex             # ~/.codex/skills + commands
./install.sh --agent agents            # ~/.agents/skills shared by OpenCode/Pi
./install.sh --agent all               # every supported global target
./install.sh --agent opencode --project # local .opencode/ install
./install.sh --agent pi --project       # local .pi/ install
```

## Critical Rules (Always Active)

1. READ FULL SCOPE before touching any asset
2. NEVER hunt theoretical bugs — "Can attacker do this RIGHT NOW?"
3. Run 7-Question Gate BEFORE writing any report
4. KILL weak findings fast — N/A hurts your validity ratio
5. 5-minute rule — nothing after 5 min = move on
6. **LEAD BOARD — never lose a lead.** After recon, run `lead_board.py ingest <target>` + `show`, and route each finding to its `hunt-*` skill in plain language ("GraphQL endpoint → hunt-graphql"). When starting/killing/reporting a lead, `touch` its status. The hunter focuses on one lead at a time; the board remembers the rest so none is forgotten. Surface stale high-priority leads unprompted.
7. NEVER redact evidence in a report, no matter how sensitive — see VAPT Standard §1.5
8. **NEVER publish an Artifact unless the user explicitly asks for one.** Write files to disk only. Do not call the Artifact tool proactively.

## VAPT Client Report Formatting Standard (Mandatory for All Future Reports)

Full spec: `rules/vapt_report_format.md` — the enforced format for every client-facing VAPT PDF report (myco.io, buypass.ai, and any future engagement): tone/typography, cover page + footer HTML/CSS, running footer, section/page-break rules, the six section playbooks, prohibited content, legacy formats to avoid, the informational-findings register, HTML retention, dark code-evidence-block spec, pre-render grep checks, and the canonical reference template. Read it in full before generating or editing any client VAPT report — do not improvise report formatting from memory.

Critical Rule #7 above (never redact evidence) is §1.5 of that file.
